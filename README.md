# Primary

A simple educational practice game for kids and adults.

Currently there are levels dealing with Math and Language Arts.

The app is designed to allow other level sets, and in the future I'd like to add 
other math levels (ideas: word problems, easier and harder math, etc) and other subjects 
as well (ideas: reading, maps, geometry, etc?)

Features:
* Progressive levels.
* Supports multiple users.
* Can keep a log of answers in external csv files for record-keeping  purposes (eg homeschooling).

Math Features:
* Basic addition, subtration, multiplication, and division levelsets.
* Sorting if 1, 2, and 3 digit numbers.

Language Arts Features:
* Spelling common words
* Pluralization
