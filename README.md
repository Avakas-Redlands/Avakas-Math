# Primary

A simple educational practice game for kids and adults.

Currectly there is a set of levels of basic math: low-number addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The app is designed to allow other level sets, and in the future I'd like to add 
other math levels (ideas: word problems, easier and harder math, etc) subjects as well 
(ideas: spelling, reading, maps, geometry, etc?)

Features:
* Progressive levels.
* Supports multiple users.
* Can keep a log of answers in external csv files for record-keeping  purposes.
